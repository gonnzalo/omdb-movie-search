# OMDb Coding Challenge

Is a simple web app, so I decided to start my project with CRA. I use React Router to dynamically render components and query params to fetch the data.
Example:

[https://omdb-coding-challenge.gonnzalo.now.sh/search/halloween?year=1978&type=movie](https://omdb-coding-challenge.gonnzalo.now.sh/movie/tt0077651)

If I could have dedicated more time, I would write tests and work in the design.
