# OMDb Coding Challenge

Is a simple web app, so I decided to start my project with CRA. I use React Router to dynamically render components and query params to fetch the data.
Example:

http://localhost:3000/search/halloween?year=1978&type=movie

http://localhost:3000/movie/tt0077651

If I could have dedicated more time, I would write tests and work in the design.

### live demo

## Installation

1- Clone the repository and install the node modules:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/gonnzalo/omdb-coding-challenge
cd omdb-coding-challenge/
git install
```

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

_no tests yet_

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`
